//! this is immutable
// Scalar values
const answer = 42;
const greeting = 'Hello';


//! on the other hand this is mutable as only ref. remains constant
// Arrays and Objects
const numbers = [2, 4, 6];
const person = {
  firstName: 'John',
  lastName: 'Doe',
};

//!object.freeze() helps in freezing objects but that too at only one level
